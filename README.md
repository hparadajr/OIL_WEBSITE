# Oil_Website

## Overview
I integrated an AI-powered chatbot into a Squarespace website using an embedded HTML script. This project demonstrates how third-party AI services can be safely and effectively deployed on a client-facing site without backend access.

The focus of this repository is the **HTML-based integration workflow**, secure configuration practices, and real-world deployment constraints when working within a CMS like Squarespace.

---

## Project Goals
- Embed an AI chatbot into Squarespace
- Maintain security by removing sensitive credentials
- Ensure clean, readable, and reusable HTML
- Document the integration clearly for non-technical stakeholders

---

## What I Built
- A floating **AI chatbot widget “Ask Alfred”** embedded via HTML
- A configuration-safe script using a **placeholder chatbot ID**
- A deployable solution compatible with Squarespace’s Code Injection system

This mirrors how developers commonly integrate analytics tools, chat widgets, or AI assistants into CMS-based websites.

---

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**
- Third-party AI embed (Chatbase)
- Squarespace Code Injection (Header / Footer)

> NOTE: No custom JavaScript logic was written as the integration relies entirely on HTML embedding and external scripts.

---

## What I Learned
- Deploying AI features inside a CMS environment
- Working within platform limitations (no backend access)
- Abstracting sensitive configuration for public repositories
- Presenting real client-style work in a professional GitHub format

---

## Use Case
This project reflects a real-world scenario where a developer:
- Works with a non-technical client
- Uses a no-code website builder
- Adds advanced functionality using HTML
